This README maintains a professional structure while:

1. Refocusing the content on task execution rather than just agent communication
2. Emphasizing the practical applications of AI swarm technology
3. Highlighting the key differentiator (actually completing tasks vs just storing them)
4. Keeping the technical setup instructions from the original project
5. Adding relevant use cases for a task execution system
